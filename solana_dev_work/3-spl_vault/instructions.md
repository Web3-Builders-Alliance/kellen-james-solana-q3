**Challenge Three**

In your current challenge, you're not just performing a basic token transfer. Instead, you're transferring ownership of SPL tokens to a vault, which might be governed by a custom program. This requires a more hands-on approach to constructing the transaction, giving you direct control over how data is serialized and sent.

1. Load the IDL for the WBA Vault
2. vault_init.ts - Initialize an Account with WBA Vault | **DONE**
3. vault_deposit.ts - Deposit native Solana | **DONE**
4. vault_withdraw.ts - Withdraw native Solana | **DONE**
5. vault_deposit_spl.ts - Deposit your SPL token | **DONE**
6. vault_withdraw_spl.ts - Withdraw SPL token | **DONE**

*Each successful interaction increases your WBA Score.*
